        <h1 id="about">About</h1>
        <p>Classic cars are vehicles that were produced from the early 1900s to the late 1970s.
            These vehicles are usually associated with a certain era or time period,
            and they often have unique design features that distinguish them from modern cars.
            Classic cars are highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts due to their rarity,
            historical significance, and aesthetic appeal. They are often seen at car shows and vintage car rallies,
            where owners showcase their vehicles and enthusiasts come together to appreciate classic cars.

            Classic cars come in many different shapes and sizes, from the sleek and elegant designs of the 1930s to the
            powerful muscle
            cars of the 1960s and 1970s. They are often restored and maintained to their original condition,
            with attention paid to every detail, from the engine to the upholstery.

            Owning and maintaining a classic car requires a significant amount of time and effort, but for many
            enthusiasts,
            the joy of owning and driving a piece of automotive history is well worth the investment.
            Classic cars are not just vehicles, they are a connection to the past and a celebration of the ingenuity
            and craftsmanship of the automotive industry.
